## Introduction

A library of high-quality components for creating beautiful onboarding and product education in your React apps.
The library helps developers build better onboarding experiences faster so they can focus on what matters most: building great products.


## Install

#### With yarn

```bash
yarn add @frigade/react-onboarding-components
```

#### With npm

```bash
npm install @frigade/react-onboarding-components
```

## Supercharge your onboarding flows
While the above examples contain hard-coded strings and images for illustrative purposes, we highly recommend loading your strings and presentation
layer logic from your API rather than as plain strings in your app.

We built [Frigade](https://frigade.com/) to work seamlessly with `react-onboarding-components` and make it easier for developers to build and scale onboarding. 
With Frigade, you can update onboarding flow without releasing to the app store, integrate 3rd party analytics (Segment, Mixpanel, etc.) to power user targeting, and integrate our API/webhooks to make user data input easy.
