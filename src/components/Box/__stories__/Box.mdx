Ok, so here's the deal with `Box`: It's a component that makes other components easier to build.

The key to its magic is that it accepts our full set of theming and styling props, as well as the polymorphic `as` prop that you may recognize from everywhere else because everyone has a `Box` component nowadays.

You can start to see the utility of this setup pretty quickly:

<Source
  code={`
// It can impersonate other components or HTML tags
<Box as='p'>I'm rendered in a paragraph tag!</Box>
`}
/>

<Source code={`
import styled from 'styled-components'

// You can add the 'css' and 'overrides' props to any other component
const Button = styled(Box)({
backgroundColor: 'fuschsia',
})

<Button
  overrides={{
    colors: {
      tangy: 'tangerine',
    },
  }}
  css={({ theme }) => ({
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.tangy,
  })}
/>
`} />
