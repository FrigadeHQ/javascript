If you're looking for the full / stable version of Frigade that we all know and love, head over to our main [React SDK](https://github.com/FrigadeHQ/javascript/tree/main/packages/react).

Okay, now that we've gotten that important caveat out of the way: Welcome to the developer preview of the Frigade React SDK V2!

We're building our new version in public so that you can have a look around if you'd like, contribute ideas, point out API inconsistencies, test out how our new features will integrate into your existing Frigade setup, etc.

If you'd like more information about getting early access to V2, [reach out](mailto:hello@frigade.com).
